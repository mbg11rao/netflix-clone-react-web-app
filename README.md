## Introduction
The Netflix Clone React Web App is a visually appealing and functional clone of the Netflix platform. It is designed to provide a similar user experience, allowing users to browse through a variety of movies and TV shows, view details about each, and enjoy a seamless UI.

The app leverages React.js for a dynamic user interface and state management, while integrating with the TMDB API to fetch real-time data on movies and TV shows.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts (optional feature).
- **Home Page:** Displays a curated list of movies and TV shows, categorized by genres and popularity.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for movies and TV shows using the search bar.
- **Movie/TV Show Details:** Each movie and TV show has its own detail page with an overview, ratings, and additional information.
- **Dynamic UI Components:** Includes sliders, carousels, and other UI components that replicate the Netflix experience.
- **API Integration:** Fetches data from the TMDB API to provide up-to-date movie and TV show information.
